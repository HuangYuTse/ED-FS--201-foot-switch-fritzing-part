You are free to use this fritzing part(by giving me a star XD)  

請注意本圖示pcb部分請挑選自己合適的方案  
因為此元件本身就只有留三條導線  
所以pcb如何布局全看個人  
Please pay attention to the pcb part of this picture, please choose your own suitable solution  
Because this component only leaves three wires  
So how the PCB layout depends on the individual
